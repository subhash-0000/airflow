fix(api): disable uvloop if PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG=1 to prevent segfault (issue #61214)

<!--
Thank you for contributing!

This PR disables uvloop and falls back to the default asyncio event loop if PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG=1 is set, preventing a segmentation fault in the Airflow API server on Python 3.13+ (see issue #61214). A warning is emitted at startup if this configuration is detected.
